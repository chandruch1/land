LAND FRACTIONALIZATION
Welcome to the Landshare Protocol, a project designed to revolutionize real estate ownership through blockchain technology. This protocol facilitates the fractionalization of land assets, enabling tokenized, secure, and transparent real estate investments.

Project Overview
The Landshare Protocol leverages a suite of modern web technologies and smart contracts to create a decentralized platform for real estate investment. By tokenizing land assets, we aim to democratize access to real estate, increase liquidity, and simplify the investment process for everyone.

Key Features:

Asset Tokenization: Convert physical land assets into tradable digital tokens on the blockchain.

Decentralized Ownership: Secure, transparent, and immutable ownership records powered by smart contracts.

Democratized Investment: Lower the barrier to entry for real estate investment by enabling fractional ownership.

Technologies Used
This project is built using a robust and modern technology stack to ensure performance, security, and a seamless user experience.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects.

TypeScript: A strongly typed language that enhances code quality and maintainability.

React: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

shadcn-ui: A collection of accessible and customizable UI components for React.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.

Solidity: The primary language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
